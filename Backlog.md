### New ideas:
* Minecraft algorithm generator
* Mafia game helper
  * helps you assign roles, go through the night sequence, and the day sequence, including in what order to announce events. Keeps track of who's alive and dead and other variables.

### To keep working on:
* General games
* SoundTrainer
* My Site
* 3D Renderer
* Unstable unicorns (and make standalone grammar thing)
